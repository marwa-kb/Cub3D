Description: with my teammate, we had to create a “realistic” 3D graphical representation of the inside of a maze from a first-person perspective, using the Ray-Casting principles.  

Constraints:
* use the miniLibX.
* smooth management of the window: changing to another window, minimizing, etc.
* display different wall textures that vary depending on which side the wall is facing (North, South, East, West).
* possibility to set the floor and ceiling colors to two different ones.
* the left and right arrow keys of the keyboard must allow you to look left and right in the maze.
* the W, A, S, and D keys must allow you to move the point of view through the maze.
* pressing ESC must close the window and quit the program cleanly.
* clicking on the red cross on the window’s frame must close the window and quit the program cleanly.
* the program must take as a first argument a scene description file with the .cub extension.
* the map must be composed of only 6 possible characters: 0 for an empty space, 1 for a wall, and N,S,E or W for the player’s start position and spawning orientation. Example of a simple valid map:  
111111  
100101  
101001  
1100N1  
111111
